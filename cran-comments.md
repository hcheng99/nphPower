## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* added references to DESCRIPTION
* removed \dontrun{} from all examples. For several examples that 
  take more than 5 seconds to run, I wrapped examples in \donttest{}       
* added Value section to summary.NPHpwr.Rd
* fixed minor issues in the code

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. (full details at 
https://win-builder.r-project.org/VRu0Q1hvQczI/00check.log)

There were several NOTEs:
* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE

  The listed words are author names and test name. 
  
* Found the following (possibly) invalid DOIs:

  DOI: 10.2307/253191 is valid. The website - https://doi.org/10.2307/2531910
